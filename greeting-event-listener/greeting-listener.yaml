  Passively listen for cloud events where the type equals "greetingcloudevent" and
  then execute a action state to call the direktiv/greeting action, which 'greets' 
  the user specified in the "name" field of the input provided to the workflow.

  Because this workflow has a start of type event, directly executing this workflow 
  is not necessary.

#
# Start of type event definition sets the workflow to be executed when a event
# is triggered with the defined type 'greetingcloudevent'
#
start:
  type: event
  state: greeter
  event:
    type: greetingcloudevent

functions:
  - id: greeter
    image: direktiv/greeting:v4
    type: knative-workflow
  
states:
  - id: greeter
    type: action
    action: 
      function: greeter
      input: jq(.greetingcloudevent)
    transform: 'jq({ "greeting": .return.greeting })'
